# Flutter Exponea SDK
Flutter Exponea SDK allows your application to interact with the [Exponea](https://exponea.com/) Customer Data & Experience Platform. Exponea empowers B2C marketers to raise conversion rates, improve acquisition ROI, and maximize customer lifetime value.

Flutter SDK is implemented as a wrapper around [native Android SDK](https://github.com/exponea/exponea-android-sdk) and [native iOS SDK](https://github.com/exponea/exponea-ios-sdk).

## Getting started

        git:
          url: git@github.com:exponea/exponea-flutter-sdk.git
